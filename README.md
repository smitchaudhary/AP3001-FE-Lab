# AP3001-FE-Lab

## Usage

- Either download the project zip-file from Github or clone using git
- Download the latest Julia release for your system: http://julialang.org
- Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the project
- launch julia
- Issue the following command from the julia command line:

```
include("tsunami.jl")
```

The first time this will take a long time since the correct packages need to be downloaded and compiled. Subsequent executions should finish much faster.
